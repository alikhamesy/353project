INNATE: Every time Zac damages at least one enemy with an ability, he sheds, depending on the ability, a number of chunks of himself to a nearby location, landing towards visible nearby enemy champions and lasting for 6 seconds. Both Zac and enemy champions can interact with these chunks by being within 50 units of them: Zac can move over them to consume them, restoring 4 / 5 / 6 / 7% (based on Lets Bounc Lets Bounce!s rank) of his maximum health; enemy champions can move over them to destroy them. Periodically, upon taking fatal damage, Zac dispels all Malefic debuffs, sets his current health to 50%, and temporarily becomes untargetable and unable to act, creating 4 uncontrollable bloblets that are briefly untargetable while splitting, each having 12% of Zacs maximum health, which move to Zacs final location over 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 / 4 (based on level) seconds. Any post-mitigation damage the bloblets receive are also directed to Zac in true damage but Zac himself cannot take damage from other sources. If any of these bloblets remain alive until the end of the duration, Zac Revival recombines and returns at 10 - 50% maximum health. Upon splitting, the bloblets stop upon colliding with terrain.'},
